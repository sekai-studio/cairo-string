# cairo-string

A lib to manipulate strings in Cairo on StarkNet

_The doc needs to be written but the code is commented using Python Docstrings standards (kinda)_

## Use & test runs

Install the `cairo-lang` and `starknet-devnet` python librairies (a virtual environment is advised)
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Install the node modules
```
yarn
```
Start the local devnet in a terminal
```
yarn net
```
Run the tests on another terminal
```
yarn test
```
